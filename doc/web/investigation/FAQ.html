<h2><a name="Owns" id="Owns"></a>Who owns the project ?</h2>
<p> The project is not proprietary. It does not - and will not - belong to any
  particular people or organization. This is because we aim to build standards
  and tools for the UFO community as a whole. This is guaranted by the Open Source
  <a href="License.html">license</a> of the product.</p>
<h2><a name="OpenSource"></a>What is an &quot;Open Source&quot; project ?</h2>
<p>Open Source means that the source code of the software will be available to
  anyone. Anyone is allowed to use it, modify it or even sell
  it - but that's not the problem of the project - freely. It also means that
  you'll be able to check/read what the source code really does (i.e. it's neither
  a
  spyware
  nor a virus, etc.)</p>
<h2><a name="Change"></a>Can I change something to the project ?</h2>
<p>The project is yours. The more you get involved, the more it will fit your
  needs, and the more it will avoid what you want to avoid for such a project.
  The project cannot be successful if it doesn't fit its user's needs. Feel free
  to register to a project mailing list &#8212; <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/rr0-domain">rr0-domain</a> for
  the ufology aspect of the project, <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/rr0-developers">rr0-developers</a> for
  the technical aspect, etc. &#8212; to discuss the project.</p>
<h2><a name="Cost"></a>How much will it cost ?</h2>
<p>The project is free. It is not funded, and working efforts are
  not reimbursed. However, the results will always freely
  available to the public - including UFO people or UFO
  organizations - for whatever way others can use it. A Reference Implementation
  will be made available to the public.</p>
<h2><a name="EndDate" id="EndDate"></a>When will the project be finished
  ?</h2>
<p>This is quite difficult to predict in an Open Source project, where the work
  rate depends on the number of contributors, and contributors' available time.
  So it may take one year or five, it depends on your will to work on it.</p>
<h2><a name="ProbableEnd" id="ProbableEnd"></a>What probability to see this project
  finished ?</h2>
<p>The project will be finished, whatever the &quot;ups &amp; downs&quot;.
  Aside from the dominant interest (an important step for ufology) is the technical
  interest for a bunch of software engineers. So
UFO@home is a double challenge.</p>
<h2><a name="Name"></a>Why the &quot;UFO@home&quot; name ?</h2>
<p>UFO@home (pronounce &quot;UFO at home&quot;) represents the ability for anybody
  to testify, browse and work on UFO material from home, through an Internet
  connection. As the SETI@home project &#8212; that has no relationship with
  this project &#8212; which inspired the project's name, it may also allow in
  the future some computation (statistical analysis for instance)
distributed on multiple UFO@home servers.</p>
<h2><a name="rr0" id="rr0"></a>Why the &quot;RR0&quot; or&quot;UFO@home&quot; names
  sometimes in the project ?</h2>
<p>RR0 is the name of the website that initiated the project, which first took
  the name &quot;UFO@home&quot; (<em>RR0 Information System</em>), before being
  called &quot;UFO@home&quot;. So you can see &quot;rr0&quot; sometimes,
  as the historical codename of the project.</p>
<h2><a name="Who"></a>Who work on the project ?</h2>
<p>Several people with business/domain (ufology experts) and technical (software
  engineers), but any people is welcomed to contribute, ask questions, give its
  opinion or work on any aspect of the project.</p>
<h2><a name="Opinion"></a>What is the opinion of the project about UFOs ?</h2>
<p>The UFO@home project aims to develop a tool to help to study the UFO phenomenon
  more efficiently, not to conclude on this phenomenon (this is the job of ufologists
  who will use this tool) and so has no opinion on the  phenomenon itself.
  It just recognize the phenomenon as real, with a potential scientifique interest,
  but does not conclude on any explanation for this phenomenon.
  It does not reject any hypothesis, and aims to allow every people (defenders
  of PSH, ETH, etc.) to work on the same data,
  but with their own methodologies.</p>
<h2><a name="Partnership" id="Partnership"></a>Are partnerships possible ?</h2>
<p>Any organization is welcomed to contribute to the project. However it cannot
  belong to any organization in particular. It intend to provide a tool for all
  people and organizations interested in ufology.</p>
<h2><a name="Copyright"></a>Why a copyright in the project license ?</h2>
<p>An <a href="http://www.opensource.org">Open Source Software </a>  is described
  as <em>copyleft</em>,
  because it aims to grant the users the rights to use, redistribute, and modify
  the software at their own will. On the contrary of software without licence 
  (from public domain, which doesn't impose any restrictions nor any liberties),
  a copyright allows to enforce those liberties.</p>
<p>As stated in the license, the fact that the copyright
  is &quot;J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Beau&quot; (founder of de RR0.org)  doesn't have
  any impact on the rights to use, distribute, modify, or even sell the software
  with such an Open Source license.
  It is just d'une reconnaissance
  de l'auteur de
  l'initiative.
   Par la suite si une entit&eacute; organisationnelle se cr&eacute;ait pour
   g&eacute;rer 
  UFO@home, le copyright serait au nom de cette entit&eacute; (il est diffile
  d'envisager une association ufologique existante afin de ne pas donner au projet
  une couleur
  
  partisane).</p>
<h2><a name="French"></a>Why some french  in the pages ?</h2>
<p>The project started in french, launched by a french ufological static
  website.
The project is now being translated into english continuously.</p>
<h2><a name="RR0"></a>What becomes RR0.org ?</h2>
<p>The RR0.org static website will continue to evolve in parallel to  UFO@home.
  Once UFO@home achieved and the whole set of data migrated from RR0.org to UFO@home, the static website will be deprecated and may disapear.</p>
<h2><a name="ChangeWeb"></a>Can we change the website ; I don't like its aspect
  or structure</h2>
<p>This website is about the project, not the end-user product. However, as the
  product, it can be changed. Nothing is imutable in the project, and all remarks
  are welcomed.</p>
